# Homework 12 - SQL: Employee Tracker - Michael Mallon

## What I did

This week I used Object Oriented Programming to build an application that creates an HTML website with information collected in the terminal. The app will also make decisions about what the HTML website will look like based on a user's selection.


<br>

### Motivation:
This was the first step twards buinding an application that renders HTML by itself. I know this concept will be used a lot going forward and there are endless possibilities as to how/ where it can be used.

<br>

### Problems I solved:
    * Built appropriate file system 
    * Used inquirer to request user input in the CLI
    * Built classes for different employee job titles
    * Constructed test files and used Jest to verify data

<br />
<br />

## Installation:
Download all associated files in this repository. Install Node.js then use the `npm install` function. After that, CD to the directory the root application folder is installed in and use the `node index.js` function.
